# Real-Time Parking Slot Display for LED Screens

## Overview
Real-Time Parking Slot Display is a web application designed to identify and display available parking spaces in real-time on LED screens using computer vision and WebSockets technology. The platform aims to improve parking efficiency in smart cities by providing up-to-date information on parking slot availability directly on LED screens.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Utilizes WebSockets to provide live updates on parking slot availability.

- **Interactive UI**:
  - Features intuitive sliders displaying available slots and detailed slot information.

- **Computer Vision Integration**:
  - Employs computer vision techniques to accurately identify and monitor parking space occupancy.

- **LED Screen Display**:
  - Real-time parking slot information displayed on LED screens for easy visibility.

- **Secure Communication**:
  - Uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) for secure data transmission.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-End Development**:
  - React JS for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
  - CSS for styling the UI.

- **Real-Time Communication**:
  - WebSockets for real-time updates and seamless data flow.

- **Back-End Development**:
  - Node.js for server-side operations.
  - Integration with computer vision algorithms for detecting parking slot status.
